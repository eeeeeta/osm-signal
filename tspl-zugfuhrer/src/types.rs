///
/// ## Identification
///
/// Like schedules, trains have their own "trainsplorer ID", which is used
/// as an opaque identifier for other services to report updates to the train's
/// running.
///
/// ## Relationship to schedules
///
/// Trains are created from a parent schedule, and retain information about
/// which schedule this was (primarily to enable nice UI features like 'view
/// other trains running to this schedule').
///
/// However, this schedule can be from multiple different sources - VSTP,
/// Darwin, or CIF/ITPS. The train movements for the train incorporate all
/// available schedule data for the train from these sources, often copied
/// from the relevant schedule(s).
///
/// ## Deduplication
///
/// Keeping information about the originating schedule also allows the display
/// of the schedule to be suppressed later, when something attempts to combine
/// train running information with schedule data.
